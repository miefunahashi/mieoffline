            My name is Mie Funahashi, born and raised in Japan. I was interested in cultural exchange through the
            experience of hosting a student from Malaysia and going abroad.At Chukyo University, I studied American and
            British Cultural Studies. After graduation, I worked for Kinki Nippon Tourist about 3 years, I decided to go
            to the UK.<br>
            I moved to London in 2010. I enjoyed meeting new people from different cultural back ground, seeing historic
            and new things in London such as historic buildings, markets, parks, museums and galleries. It is clich√© but
            I wanted to change my life in a different environment and started new career.
            Working at a travel agency and production company in London, I picked up art courses in Heathery School of
            Art. The passion of drawing and making was brought back to life from my childhood. In 2012, I studied
            Foundation in Art and Design at Kingston University. I was fascinated by visual communication. In 2013, I
            studied further in MA Communication Design: Graphic Design at Kingston University.<br>
            Currently I live in Camden, London (with lovely husband:)
            I'm excited to start my career as a graphic designer soon.
